# 5GReplay


**5Greplay** is a 5G network traffic fuzzer that enables the evaluation of 5G components by replaying and modifying 5G network traffic, by creating and injecting network scenarios into a target that can be a 5G core service (e.g., AMF, SMF) or a RAN network (e.g., gNodeB). The tool provides the ability to alter network packets online or offline in both control and data planes in a very flexible manner.
